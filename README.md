# BlackOps3Shaders
 A repository of some shaders I made for Black Ops III.

# Installation
 Download the latest release and extract all of the files into the Black Ops III directory.

# Usage
 This repo includes a base for GBuffer shaders (no techsetdef included)
 
 And it also contains 6 ready to use post effects that can be previewed in APE:
 * zm_afterlife_alcatraz
 * zm_afterlife_alcatraz_visionset
 * zm_afterlife_alcatraz_lerp (Effect is layered on top of the frame)
 * zm_afterlife_alcatraz_lerp_visionset (Effect is layered on top of the frame)
 * zm_whoswho
 * zm_whoswho_visionset

You can find them in the 'shader_templates' GDT.

You can immediately include them in your zone file and use them in your maps.

To preview the post effects first set the Rendering to No Lighting and then set the Shape to Plane.

Black Ops II Vision previews aren't a 100% accurate to the game so it can be a bit brighter or darker in-game.
