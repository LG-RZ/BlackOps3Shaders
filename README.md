# BlackOps3Shaders
 A repository of some shaders I made for Black Ops III.

# Installation
 Download the latest release and extract all of the files into the Black Ops III directory.

# Usage
 This repo includes:
 * A base for GBuffer shaders (no techsetdef included).
 * zm_afterlife_alcatraz (Post Effect).
 * zm_afterlife_alcatraz_visionset (Post Effect).
 * zm_afterlife_alcatraz_lerp (Post Effect).
 * zm_afterlife_alcatraz_lerp_visionset (Post Effect).
 * zm_whoswho (Post Effect).
 * zm_whoswho_visionset (Post Effect).
 * chromatic_aberration (Post Effect).
 * mtl_tv_chromatic_aberration (A material that can be applied on brushes or models that will apply the chromatic aberration effect on everything behind it).

You can find all of these in the 'shader_templates' GDT.

To preview the post effects first set the Rendering to No Lighting and then set the Shape to Plane by right clicking on the APE preview and setting each option.

Black Ops II Visionset effects are using T6 vision settings and their previews aren't a 100% accurate to the game so it can be a bit brighter or darker in-game.
